        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>8 ears corn on the cob, unhusked</li>

         <li> <strong>Step 1</strong> <p> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper baking cups.</p>
        </li> 
        <li> <strong>Step 2</strong> <p>Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl until evenly blended; set aside.

        </p>
        
        </li>  
        
        <li> <strong>Step 3</strong> <p>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture, mixing until just incorporated.

        </li>

        <li> <strong>Step 4</strong> <p>Divide cake batter into four separate bowls. Add a few drops of food coloring into one bowl of batter and stir; add more food coloring if necessary to reach the desired shade. Repeat with remaining colors and bowls of batter.
        </p>
        
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Step 5</strong> <p>  Using a different spoon for each color batter, spoon a small portion of each color into the cupcake liners, until 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not mix the batter once it is in the cupcake liner.       

        </p>
        
        </li>

        <li> <strong>Step 6</strong> <p> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
